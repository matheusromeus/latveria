distributed systems that process work in real-time (APIs), but also asynchronously (queues + workers).

asynchronous or event driven system

Message queues are really useful when working with micro services.

- Rate limit processing of events
- Communicate between micro services
- Shard the load of specific types of events to be processed at different rates
- Batch process a bunch of events

Letâ€™s say your app needs to send out an email campaign to millions of customers. Rather than spinning up one mega server to handle and send out all the emails.

- throw those emails on a queue
- have worker pods scale and pick them up
- send out the emails asynchronously
