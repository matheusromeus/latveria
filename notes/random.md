complex adaptive systems

actions, seemingly made without any regards to the ecosystem as a whole, by individuals, ultimately shapes the ecosystem?

	the individuals follow their own local rules. and make their own decisions based on limited information. but despite acting independently, their collective actions shape and influence the overall system.

cellular automata is a perfect example of a complex adaptive system

with each degree, we are predicting based on a prediction which was based on an assumption. so it gets more and more likely to get wrong. the uncertainty compounds. like how a small initial deviation can lead to largely wrong final results. (eg: this is the **butterfly effect** in chaos theory)

**something to be vary about AI in the future** models predict outcomes based on patterns learned from past data, but if those patterns were themselves shaped by flawed assumptions, biases get reinforced.
