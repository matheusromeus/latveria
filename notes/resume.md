- be specific, what kinda engineer are you, what exactly do you do?
- no projects in the relevant tech stack
- techstack not relevant to the job
- too much text
- not technical enough
- be honest, please.
- make it readable bullet points
- have live links and relevant projects
- sometimes i feel you have no jobs available here
- if you don't have a good github repo, don't include it
- remove gaps


HRs don't know SHIT about tech.
but engineers do know. how to tackle both these ends?

make a frontend and fullstack resume
the correct tech stack - not too many, not too less

use the jake's overleaf template

they care more about experience

experience should have things you have done with the technologies and relevance to the job
have a couple of live links and relevant project

fs
- typescript, python, javascript, html, css
- Node, Next Js, MongoDB
- SQL, react, api, rest
- cloud, agile, ci/cd, 
- cross-functionally
- architecture, extra language, git

how did you use the relevant technology in your experience 

apply early

"why is it high performance"

40 %, 60% faster stats mean nothing to some pople
