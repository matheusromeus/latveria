a big network of meaningful, interlinked but unnoticeable relationships.

humans are inherently bad at analyzing complex systems.

but it is one of the skills that you need, to reach the depth of any field.
and the better you are at it, the breadth of fields you will be able to master is infinite.

a.k.a systems thinking.

it is THE WAY to become a polymath.

	imagine trying to understand a person fully in 10 minutes of meeting them. it's virtually impossible to achieve this. how would you get to know this person? how long would it take? now take this approach and translate it to any real world system which is as complex and intricate as a human being.

it took probably centuries for the systems to be written and formed in stone. but with almost the same amount of advancements in merely decades, have we as humans had the time to understand and internalize this? are we equipped to understanding the intricacies? or is that something we have to embed into the next generation of genes?

curiosity is the antidote. a fundamental shift in mindset.

hypothesis > act on it > find that you are wrong > repeat until you are right.
without step 1 you will be stuck.

understanding the big picture. and then fine graining accordingly.

finding relationships || patterns between elements.
