3 parts to a filesystem

the disk
FS format
folder structure

so when people talk about linux filesystem, they're actually referring to the folder structure

the disk is just a stream of raw bytes, the FS formatting is just the logical grouping of those bytes, so you don't have to memorize addresses.
