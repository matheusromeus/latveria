everytime a user signs in, that is, when a user is created, we create a subscriber. 

we would need both no code and code worflows.
- no code - for notifications that show latest information
- code - some action in the app done by any user triggers a notification. like a workspace invite or a collaboration thingy.


a trigger starts a workflow.

there are steps in a workflow.

Once a workflow is initiated by its trigger, the steps within the workflow are executed in a specific sequence.
