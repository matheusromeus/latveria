compilers

compilers translate your high level programming language into machine code that the CPU understands, Assembly language is just the human readable representation of that machine instruction.


every C program has 4 components
- Heap - manual memory allocation (malloc, calloc, global, static)
- Stack -  
- Register - general and reserved (ebp, esp) esp - ebp is length of stack
- Instructions

32 bit, 64 bit 

stack frame for each function? is that an execution context?
