it's how individuals and firms make themselves well off in a world of scarcity

constrained optimization

the best decisions with tradeoffs.

every action has a tradeoff

opportunity cost

---

we understand these trade offs by building simplified models
a model - description of any relationship between two or more variables

supply X demand

price is negative to demand
price is positive to quantity


market failure
equity or fairness

capitalist X command models

constrained cpaitalist econonmy

command - ensures right goods are produced and it reaches the right people. theory. it doesnt work in practice. 

the opposite is the market decides what should get produced, how much it should produce. but can lead to tremendous inequality.



socialist is government controlling the industry, halfway between command and capitalist

all the countries are a different level of constrained capital economies
