### Use semi-transparent overlays to imply a light source
In a standard UI design, colors don't change depending on the elevation of the component or element. In Dark Mode, there's an "implied light source" that gives components lighter or darker colors depending on how high they're elevated. In other words, the components behave as though they were illuminated by a flashlight held in front of the screen. The closer they get to the light source, the more washed out they'll be.

Contrast is key for Dark mode.
Use brand colors sparingly.
Low saturation colors.
