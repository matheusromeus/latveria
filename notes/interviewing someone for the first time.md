The _introduction_ phase of the interview is intended to put the candidate at ease. I ask them if they had a nice flight. I spend about 30 seconds telling the person who I am and how the interview will work. I always reassure candidates that we are interested in _how_ they go about solving problems, not the actual answer.

tell them about you and the company.


Again, ask open-ended questions and sit back and listen, with only the occasional “tell me more about that” if they seem to stall.
