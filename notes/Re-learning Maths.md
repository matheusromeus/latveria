### Pythagoras Theorem

imagine in a 2d game, the screen is represented as x and y axis. we can use this to find the shortest distance between any two points. as the dimensions increase, you can just increase the variables in the formula.

### Vectors

We know the position of a point, the point can also be the distance travelled from the origin. a vector can also show the direction in which the point is travelling towards. 

the length is the magnitude of the vector. to get total length of multiple vectors, we just add the respective variables of it. 

a vector with length 1 = unit vector

any vector can be converted into a unit vector through normalization.

mostly used to find and represent the direction.
