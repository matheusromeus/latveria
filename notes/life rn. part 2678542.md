i am fully showing signs of ADHD. everyday is a battle. mostly against the way i was programmed for 23 years of my life. it's been more than a year since i have escaped. but it has only gotten harder. i am someone who believes that you are having these problems only because you are strong enough to handle it. but FUCK, man. maybe others do have it too, and it just looks easier from here. 

i am so overwhelmed. i understand there is a lot of repressed emotions in me. and i have no safe space to let it all out. every facet of my life feels like a hustle, feels like i'm running out of time. every day, the world is moving at a pace i can't catch up to. and i am tired of calling myself a pussy for not being on top of everything in my life. its hard. and its even hard to do this all alone and only for myself. 

there is no one i truly love in this world. no single soul. i am the most comfortable in my head, in my space, in my thoughts. parents? honestly, i feel like i love them and want to take care of them just because it's my responsibility. nothing more, nothing less. i'm sorry to say this. and i wish it was any different. love, sex, intimacy, small talk, i've forgot it all. forgotten how it feels like. i crave that touch. pillowtalk. *smirks*

time passes me like the wind. 

life is a race that you will definitely lose if you let others select the criteria of winning. and the more more i fail to understand the world. grasp the true essence, the beauty of understanding, going deep into everything. and tying up different areas like shoelaces. 

i want to dive in. i want to learn 24x7 without a care in the world. i want to explore everything, everyone. to learn about people, philosophy, the extent of the universe, read old books, learn about gods, angels, devils.... is it too much to ask for?
