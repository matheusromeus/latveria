why don't i feel competitive? because i don't care about it. so is there something you care about? nothing. that is the truth. thats why, whatever you do, you don't feel satisfied.

so what do i care about?

why do i run away from responsibilities? why do i falter under pressure?

why don't i like falling asleep?

friends have become only people i have fun with.


i don't like what I'm becoming, but i don't have a choice. but i am still fighting against it. i don't like change. maybe it's for the better but it's not always about better or worse. i am a very nostalgic guy. i hate goodbyes. even if some were bad experiences, those were my experiences. and a part in me will always yearn to live my past again. not to undo any bad choices. but to just feel it again.
