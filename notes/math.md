broadly divided into 2.

pure math, applied math.

there's a lot of crossover between fields. BUT whatever you do is either pure or applied.


pure
- numbers - integers, natural numbers, arithmetic, cardinal, octonion, quaternion
- structures
	- equations, algebra, vectors, matrices (multi dimensional numbers) they are all in liner algebra
	- number theory
	- combinatorics, partition theory
	- group theory premutation group
	- order theory
- spaces
	- geometry
	- trigonometry
	- fractal geomtery (mandelborot set)
	- topology,mobius strip
	- measure theory
	- differential geometry
- changes
	- calculus, integrals, differentials
	- vector calculus
	- dynamical systems, chaos theory
	- complex analysis

applied
- physics (mathematical & theoretical)
- mathematical chemistry, biomathematics
- control theory in engineering
- numerical analysis
- game theory
- economics
- probability
- statistics
- mathematical finance
- optimization
- comp science - turing machine
- machine learning
- cryptography

logic, set theory, thoery of computation, complexity theory
