when you concentrate on quality of your web app on frontend, things have to be compromised in the backend.

react is for very complex web apps, so it might feel bad for devs that doesn't want that much complexity


what you are trying to do should dictate the tools you are picking


golang is for much performant backend apps, than TS.

you dont have to feel like you have to adopt golang just because it can.
