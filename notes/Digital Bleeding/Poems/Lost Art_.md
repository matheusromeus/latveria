i wanna fall in love,
not with a person..
but with my art.

i wanna fall in love,
not with the best side of you..
but with every side of you. the worst days. days i cant stand you.

i wanna persevere. think about you every single moment. i wanna obsess over you.
and my body and mind is just craving for that.

BUT. I havenâ€™t found her. my art.
