impatience is hindering my love for knowledge. i'm so obsessed with making the right use of my time that I always feel like i am wasting my time. my emotions and feelings are taking over me. it feels like time is flying past me. like it's halved. 24 hours feel like 12 hours. and i can't get myself to sleep, or control it. fall in love with being a beginner. be okay with not understanding everything life has to offer. contribute, not just consume.
