as a lean startup, an entire redesign of your app is never a good idea until it depends on your survival. and that's where we were. the whole product had taken on a completely new and evolved direction to be deemed product-market-fit and future proof. 

what confused me even more was how the designs had to support underlying business decisions. meetings with the stakeholders only brought me more anxiety as the business reasons were something i could not comprehend let alone bring those as design into our app.

that's when i actually realized the importance of good ux design. 

and this post is meant to share my thoughts and a 0.1% of my struggles of redesgining our entire app as a developer at a small startup.

- can't focus only on user experience. the design has to be driven from a business standpoint.
