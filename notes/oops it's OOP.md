just a thought on why would we implement classes - 
- we create a class so that i can create an object which in turn would be the constructor function running, and with it i can call other functions of the class when i want the extra functionality.
so, we can have repeated functionality. 

like we create a router = useRouter(). what is useRouter? it's a class!
wrong. useRouter() is actually a hook. functions have object like nature in JS.
