annotations - specify type of a variable

variables can be annotated
function params
return value of a function (can use void if no return value)

arrays -> what type would be each value?
multi dimensional arrays can also be typed.

objects too - using interfaces for the object itself or for each value


difference between *type* and *interface*?

interface is only for object shapes. 

you can make object properties optional, readonly

password: string | number

literal type -> the value can be only that particular literal | string

tuple -> array with a fixed number of elements -> [string, string, string]

enums -> a set of named constants


protected -> from within and extended subclasses
