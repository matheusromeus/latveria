*we're thieves in a world that don't want us no more..*

sometimes that's how i have felt. call me an old soul in a gen Z body, but a good game should make you feel satisfied or make you long for a place you've never been to like a good book. 

rockstar taught me how to tell a story. From experiencing disgust over the betrayal of my brothers from Grove Street to the pain of choosing one to kill in the final mission of GTA V.. The first time I held back tears over a video game was when i watched that sunrise with Arthur Morgan. 

because I hail from a humble background, I lived in your world through my cousin's PC. And with the PC that I bought with my first paycheck, I installed GTA V. I played the single player version and the online game through Epic Games. As a software engineer, playing was like reading code, and i loved to find bugs and loopholes. Ragdolls flying, Dead bodies twitching in RDR2, how the polics react to when shot on their hands are some I remember. 

I tried writing a continuation for the Vice City franchise with Tommy meeting his family and going up against a villain who was an equal match to him. But never showed the world lol :D
Maybe I can help create our own worlds together one day.

**BONUS** ~ my favorite moment in a rockstar games HAS to be the ride back in "That's the way it is" mission. A *funeral in motion*, this moment felt like what I call a Rockstar's signature move. It's the overkill attention to detail, the humor, the small pieces which puts Rockstar as my inspiration. ~
