i see a lot of people, senior and junior alike, scared of ai taking away their jobs. And I think it's understandable. But. I feel like every generation has felt the heat of something in the future replacing them and it's inevitable. basic html, css and js devs were replaced with react devs is an example. the thing is, only the basic stuff is being replaced. advanced topics and other complex phenomenons still stay the same. so, if you do not understand something atleast one thing, deeply, then you will be replaced. whatever you become, a generalist or a specialist. go deep. otherwise you will be replaced by something. people doing a lot of basic stuff with ai will be easily replaced by another ai which can act like an orchestrator. 

if you feel the heat of someone chasing you, you are right. but the catch is that you cannot outrun it your entire life, you will be caught and that is the rule of life. but if you keep a steady pace and get your basics right, your mentality right, and if you go deep enough, once it catches you, you will be able to defeat it.
