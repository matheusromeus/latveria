this is strictly for GNU/Linux users. windows users *ugh*

you need to build personal projects.  


Github authenticates users mainly through SSH keys. A pair of keys for one account each. We give the public key to github and retain our private key to confirm our identity with github.

all's well and good when you have just one git account. the ssh defaults to our created default key.

but if you want to work on your side project when you are not working at your day job, how can you do it?
