you cannot just focus on one thing. you have to be a deep generalist like in the renaissance. the return of the renaissance man. but you can do only one thing at a time. so we need to get good at context switching. just like how computers do.

you should be free to do whatever you want.

study the generalized principles of nature and become a deep generalist.

- **logic** - how to derive truth from known facts
- **rhetoric** - how to persuade, and spot persuasion tactics
- **research** - how to gather information on an unknown subject
- **statistics** - how to understand the implications of data
- **practical psychology** - how to discern and understand the true motives of others
- **investment** - how to manage and grow existing "assets"
- **agency** - how to make decisions about what course to pursue, and proactively take action to pursue it.

- **marketing/sales** - if you don't know how to attract and persuade, you will never get what you want, and your only option will be for somebody to give it to you. -> rhetoric/psychology
- **writing and thinking** - the ability to communicate the value in your unique mind. The foundation of getting in front of other people. -> Logic/research
- **entrepreneurship** - the process of taking my future into my own hands, hunting for my survival, and building products that I want to see in the world (that others care about). -> stats/agency/investment



how can i implement the process I learn?
how to identify patterns and principles in nature?
tailor what you learn to your unique lifestyle and situation

true knowledge is about discovery.


social media - how do people know about you? your brand.
content - anything you create. your work.
email marketing - newsletters or sequences to nurture your audience
visual design - your vibe
funnel building - creating landing pages, websites, and fueling them with other tech skills like content and email


YOU ARE THE NICHE.

doing what you love, documenting your journey and knowledge. your customers are people attracted to your vision and wants to be a part of it. curiosity and generalism are your strengths.

interest is generated. interest is programmed.

do work so you crave rest. rest so much that you crave work.

remember this: there will always be problems to solve. you just don't know how to hunt.

if you rely on someone else to give you a problem, you will be replaced.
