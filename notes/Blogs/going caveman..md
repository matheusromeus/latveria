i was born right into the cusp of a cyber renaissance. even when i look back at my life, i cleary see it bisected into a pre- and post- digital revolution. and i am blessed to have had experienced the former. This seismic shift was one with a promise of enlightenment. But the information over-abundance was not (and still is not!) something I was ready for. 

i have lost track of the number of times i zoned out, opened my socials, got interrupted while writing this (oh the irony!). sadly, it's a constant battle.

tell me when was the last time you spent doing nothing? absolutely nothing, in absolute silence. we always have something going in the background. something to keep us stimulated. songs in the shower, quick instagram reels while we are waiting for the bus, podcasts to lull you to sleep. an unplugged life is quite unimaginable today. and there's no sign of that stopping. and it's not just the teenagers, take a strong look at your parents too.

don't get me wrong, i love tech and my entire livelihood is dependant on it. but i am talking about how it's harder now than ever to discern the signal through all of that noise.

going caveman is something i have wanted to do for some time. and if you are into self improvement, you must have heard of the 'monk mode'. you could say it's something along those lines; a primal scream in the face of our hyperflooded age of information. this blog was an offspring of an idea, a motive. a manifesto for the unconventional. to be on our own path and strip away all the unneccessary and focus on the essentials.

the caveman didn't have the luxury of constant stimulation. feel bored. give a chance for your thoughts to erupt and break free rather than repressing it with external stimuli. the silence WILL be defeaning at first, but in that void you might just hear a whisper of your authentic self.

as a social being, this is a mighty task. going caveman can break some people. just because we are not used to it. and the others who dismiss this idea are the ones who don't know how much technology has creeped into our lives and indirectly affecting our action, thoughts, interactions and authentic connections.

in our quest of progress, we must not lose our fundamentals. our original thoughts, feelings and focus. this is not a suggestion to abandon modernity, but to be mindful of it. The future belongs to those who can navigate both worldsâ€”embracing innovation while preserving their inner caveman. i don't believe in balance, but it is what we should be striving for.
