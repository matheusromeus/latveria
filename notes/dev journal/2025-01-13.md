we have a list of audioUrls (public) and imageUrls (public). 
they are grouped by frame. so we have a list of frames.

we need to convert this into a whole video with subtitles.

so creating videos with each audio and image and then concatenating it all together.


solution
- create a util function
- use the function on server side
