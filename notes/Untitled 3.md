emerge
- Thrives in a fast-moving, self-starter environment (we strive for a culture similar to [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), but adapted for a small team)
- A strong eye for design with the ability to balance practicality, functionality, & aesthetics (Figma experience is a plus)
- Work on extracting useful insights from session replays: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, multi-modal inference
- Strong experience collaborating with PMs, designers & engineers to build new products and features
- Develop features that solve our customers' needs and pain points.
- Bonus points for experience in building LLM agents for data analysis and content generation.
- Proven experience in researching, building, and fine-tuning large language models in production environments.
- Proficiency in current large language model frameworks like LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and LlamaIndex.








🙋‍♀️ **Take extreme ownership of ideas.** This means driving ideas to completion, even when others need convincing. And, yes, there’s a fine line between extreme ownership and being an asshole. Truly cracked engineers can tread it.

👷‍♂️ **Apply themselves to the craft.** Joy comes from the craft itself, not creating shareholder value. Cracked engineers apply themselves to the craft of building products with a quasi-religious fervor, and love what they do.

This means spending a significant amount of time doing individual contributor work.

Do the stuff that arrogant senior people would find ‘boring’. Write tests. Respond to customer support queries. Go weirdly deep into some piece of analysis. Do something badly that’s not your job, so you at least understand it better.

rigorously testing ideas

write everything down.
