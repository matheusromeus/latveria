Regular values like strings and numbers contain *data*.
But a function contains an action.

Essence of callbacks - the function reference is passed around so that it can be called back later.

**A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.**

**A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.**


Computed Keys
`let` fruit `=` `prompt("Which fruit to buy?","apple");` 
`let` bag `=` `{` 
`[fruit]:` `5, 
}


for...in - used to iterate over all enumerable string properties of an object.


The dot operator requires the key to be a valid variable identifier.

**When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.**

Objects are shallow copied, while primitives are deep copied.

b = {...a}` creates a shallow copy of `a`. The top-level properties are copied(separate values), but nested objects are shared(referenced).
