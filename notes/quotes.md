`"Sometimes we don't want to heal because the pain is the last link to what we've lost." - Ibn Sina`

`Comparison isn’t just the thief of joy, it’s the thief of direction.`

`gamblers may or may not win, but the casino always wins.`

`indecision is ugly`

`follow your own natural curiosity and solve your own problems. learning is the by product of all this.`

`“I want people to be serious about learning. I want them to dig in. I want them to gain, most importantly. It's not RSA, it's not [nuanced algorithms]; those aren't important. It's that confidence in themselves they can grow and learn outside of academia: that means they don't need me. All they need is to be able to sit down with books or perhaps today the internet and go off and learn things on their own.”`
