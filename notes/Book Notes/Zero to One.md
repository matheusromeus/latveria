There are two types of progress. Horizontal and Vertical.
Vertical - 0 to 1 - technology
Horizontal - 1 to n - globalisation
In a world of scarce resources, globalisation without new technology is unsustainable.
New tech comes from startups.
Startups work on the notion that you need to work with other people to get stuff done but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

creating value is not enough, you have to capture the value that you create. like very big businesses that are bad because they don’t take profits.
Only thing that can allow a business to transcend the daily struggle for survival: monopoly profits.
monopolies are bad - but in a world where nothing changes.
history of progress is history of better monopolies replacing incumbents.

if your industry is in competitive equilibrium, then the death of your company won’t matter.
so competition is bad. but why do businesses compete? because they are similar.
a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future.
