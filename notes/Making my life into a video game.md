with order, everything is simple, straightforward. the mind craves order. because the mind wants control and control = order. even what seems like chaos has some order to it. how can we make something chaotic to something orderly?

when playing video games, you always play it with a goal in mind. you are working towards something. it’s not always for the activity itself.

a big life goal.

a series of reverse engineered goals from that big life goal to being clarity to your actions.

small goals to kick you into the flow.

treat your mind like a CPU. it has a set of programs. you can reprogram it however you want.

it’s important to tackle challenges that are just above your skill level so that you can improve. any lower, it becomes boring, any higher it becomes too hard.

till 23, i was a slave to my own mind. to my own identity. every choice i made was indirectly made by my sub-conscious; influenced by the people I interacted with, where I was born, the culture etc. I didn’t have a quest of my own, influenced by my interests. hence I chose the one society gave me.

And why is that bad? Because then you don’t have control over your own life.

ENTROPY - the degree of unpredictability or the level of chaos in various systems. this is what jesus said in the bible.

“To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.”

this is the process of inflation.

the basics

- drink water
- set a daily routine

we thought we were in a digital age. but the true digital age is yet to begin. the age where each one of us will become a computer. treating our brain as a cpu and our thoughts and actions as processes. 


open focus & narrow focus

i feel like my communication issues are caused by my lack of **genuine** interest or **genuine** curiosity in others lives. 


passion is something that grows or you create it over time. 

- **business** - meaningful work that allows you to choose the problems you solve
- **mind** - pursue your curiosity, acquiring knowledge and expanding your sense of self
- **body** - it is our obligation to understand it and improve it.
- **connections** - shared experiences, genuine, authentic relationships (like a squad is better at ranking up than solo)
