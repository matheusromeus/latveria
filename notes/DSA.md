Queue - implemented in circular fashion to not let it drift right.

array implementation
- front- -1
- rear always points to an empty location
- f=r; then queue is empty.

- n-1 elements = full
- r + 1 mod N; circular queue
- N-(f+r) = no of elements

linked list
- head and tail


double ended queues -> doubly linked list. dll will have 2 sentinel nodes at start and end. previous and next elements.
you can implement a stack and queue using dll.


Adaptor classes implement their classes using methods of other classes. Specialize a general class, by changing some methods.


inserting and removing is easier in linked lists.
reading is easier from arrays.

Sequence ADT - vector adt + list adt. vector has ranks and list has positions.
