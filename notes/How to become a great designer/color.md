so.. light is made of 7 different colors representing different wavelengths. and the objects that light strikes on may absorb all colors except the color we see on them.

so how do we see colors which are not part of these 7?

that, is something our eye does. the color is actually a mix of the wavelengths.

our eyes have 3 cones which trigger according to the wavelength of the light, S, M, L. and color blindness is one or more of the cones not working.
