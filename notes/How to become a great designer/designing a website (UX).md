## Website Strategy
the answers will help us take better design decisions. What the website should do.
- what is the goal for our website?
- how will people find our website?
- what should be the visitor's goal?
- what's the one thing we want people to do?
- how do we want user to feel when using the site?
- what is the main message to get across on the site?
- how often will the content be updated?
- who will update the content?
the brands can have a main goal and some side goals

## Project Research
Now we do research about how we can acheive these goals.
Researching about our competitors, industry best practices.

Target Audience (Demographics & Psychographics)
What are their goals and needs and pain points?
How do they currently interact with similar websites?

Competitor Analysis
Who are the main competitors?
How do they position themselves?
How are they different? How are they similar?

How are similar websites acheiving their goals?



show, don't tell. images always tell a better story.

people need to understand and be able to articulate what good design is.

every landing page has to be an experience. like talking to a person, or walking inside a store.



# Information Architecture

a sitemap is part of this step.

what information does the target audience need? you need to think from the audience perspective
what content supports the business goals?

how should we structure the content?
- what is the user's journey? and how can we support it?
- what are the most important actions? how to highlight?

Till here we do not even think about the UI.
