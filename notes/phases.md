i want to create an app that is home. that makes me feel grounded and in my senses. an all in access dashboard of my life.

everybody's dashboard should look different.

Visual hierarchy that screams “this is what matters” -> life in phases. what is important in your life right now?

everyone has a phase in life, it's time to choose yours.

like it should appear on the new tab.


how will my design solve the problem?



has a text input, like my idea for zendump. you just input it and it goes to your collection.
for now we can make it a quick mood log or a journal log.

like what mymind did, suggestions are pulled from your past entries

simple analytics of your past acheivements.

so if it's connected with LLM, you can look for keywords and understand what kind of generative UI element has to be created.
