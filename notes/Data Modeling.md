The core of data modeling comes down to **Entities, Attributes, and Relationships.**

**Entity**

An **entity** is a real-world object or concept that can be uniquely identified and described, such as a person, place, thing, event, or concept. An entity is typically represented by a table in a relational database, and **each instance of the entity is represented by a row in the table.**

**Attribute**

An **attribute** is a characteristic or property of an entity, such as a name, age, address, or color. Attributes are **represented by columns** in the table that represents the entity.

**Relationship**

A **relationship** is a connection or association **between two or more entities**. Relationships describe how entities interact or relate to each other, and are represented by lines or connectors between the entities in a data model. Relationships can be **one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.**
