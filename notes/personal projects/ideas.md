Deepest research. I notice that when I really need to study a topic in depth, I don’t want to bank on the viewpoint of a single LLM. Many times I fire up ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity in a bunch of tabs. I would love a tool that uses all the available intelligence on the internet to produce the best possible report. Key: tell me how the “experts” aka AIs differed, especially if they have contradicting facts, figures, or conclusions.
