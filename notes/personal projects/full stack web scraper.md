can we include a feature where the user inputs what he wants to scrape in the react frontend and an LLM parses it and checks with the html of the page and gives the data? fetches data from website and converts it into json and stores it in DB, and then the rss feed is generated and served as a static asset on a CDN. expose the feed as a static url using S3 the scraper can run multiple instances at one time, and can improve the scrapper logic and implement LLMs into it. the scraper is a different service running on a docker container, and a cron job is scheduled every one hour to update everything. a cron job can simply execute `docker run scraper-container` on a schedule. make a monorepo. with a node js scrapper with LLMs involved. managing monorepo with docker compose
